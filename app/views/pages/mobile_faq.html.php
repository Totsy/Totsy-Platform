    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Membership is free. You can join either by accepting an invitation from a friend or by requesting membership from Totsy's <a href="/join" title="join">registration page.</a> </div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="3"></a><strong>Q:</strong> What time do Totsy sales events start?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Sales start at 9 PM (EST). Exceptions may be made for special one-hour sales, but we will always make it clear on our site and in our emails the time a sales event begins. </div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="4"></a><strong>Q:</strong> How long does a Totsy sales event stay open?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Totsy sales events are only open for between 48 to 72 hours. Shop early since quantities are limited and hot items move fast. There is always a count-down timer displayed on the sale, so you'll never have to wonder how much time you have remaining to order and take advantage of amazing savings.</div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="5"></a><strong>Q:</strong> Is there a limit to how many items I can put in my shopping cart?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Yes, because all sales events contain a limited quantity of items, you can place up to 9 items per sales event in your shopping cart. </div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="6"></a><strong>Q:</strong> Why is there a timer on my shopping cart?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Totsy sales events are only open for a limited time and contain limited quantities of items. Therefore, to allow all shoppers an equal chance to take advantage of our sales, we must release items that are not ordered within 15 minutes of being placed in your shopping cart. The timer on your shopping cart is set to 15 minutes for each item from the time it is added to your shopping cart and will help you keep track of how much longer you have until you need to finalize your order on any given item. </div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="7"></a><strong>Q:</strong> How long can I keep items in my Totsy shopping cart? / Why do items sometimes disappear from my shopping cart? </div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> As a private sale site, our merchandise is only available in limited quantities and for a limited time. Providing a timer on your shopping cart of 15 minutes for each item allows all our customers an equal opportunity to purchase merchandise at the discounted sale price. If you place an item in your shopping cart without completing your order within 15 minutes, we will release it from your cart for other shoppers. </div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="8"></a><strong>Q:</strong> Can I put items from two different events in my shopping cart?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Yes. You can place items from as many different events as you like in your shopping cart, up to 9 items per event. </div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="9"></a><strong>Q:</strong> How do I unsubscribe to Totsy's daily email?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> To unsubscribe from our email notices, click on the unsubscribe link found at the bottom of every email. You'll be taken directly to a page where you can confirm that you want to be removed from our database. Once you confirm, we'll automatically remove you from our lists.</div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="10"></a><strong>Q:</strong> Why is it that my Internet Explorer 8 isn't working with your site?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Internet Explorer 8 includes a feature called Compatibility Mode, which tells it to pretend to be Internet Explorer 7. Not only does this fool our website, but it causes a working browser to stop working properly. Make sure you are not running Internet Explorer 8 in Compatibility Mode and this should resolve any issues.</div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="11"></a><strong>Q:</strong> I missed the sales event I was excited about. Can I still purchase items from the event?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Unfortunately, since we do not keep merchandise in stock, the sale items are no longer available for purchase after a sales event closes.</div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="12"></a><strong>Q:</strong> What are my payment options on Totsy?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Payment can be made with Visa, Mastercard, or American Express.</div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="13"></a><strong>Q:</strong> How will my order be shipped?</div>

    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="14"></a><strong>Q:</strong> How long will it take for me to get my order?</div>

Our shipping process begins at the close of a sales event when Totsy places orders directly with the brand. In order to continue bringing you amazing deals on your favorite products, our shipping process takes between 10 and 15 business days after a sales event closes. Please make sure you always consider this when choosing the size of an apparel item. <br/>

    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Items purchased from different sales events ship separately because they are received at the Totsy warehouse from each manufacturer at different times. </div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="23"></a><strong>Q:</strong> Why does my order say pending?</div>
    <div class="faq_question"><strong>A: </strong> Pending means that your order is processing in our supply chain.  It will not change from "pending" until your order has actually been shipped to you from Totsy's warehouse.</div>
    <div class="faq_answer"><a id="24"></a><strong>Q:</strong> I invited my friends to Totsy. Where are my referral credits?</div>

      <br/>

      credit cannot be applied to the account.<br/>
