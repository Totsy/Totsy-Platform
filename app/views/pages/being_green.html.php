		<p><img src="/img/being_green/carbonzero.gif" align="left" style="margin-right: 15px; margin-bottom:10px;">With every purchase you make through Totsy, we will plant one tree in the name of your child. Together with Pure Planet and Objective Carbon Zero, we are reducing the effects of deforestation, slowing the effects of global warming, preserving biodiversity, and helping small-scale farmers continue to produce diverse and localized crops. Trees will be planted in the Alto Huayabamba, located in the Amazonian highlands in Tarapoto, Peru, the most established reforestation project developed by PurePlanet.</p>
