      <p>Diana Dornan Heather is Totsy's resident Chief Mom. In corporate speak that's 
        Chief Editor and Director of Social Media, but we like to think of her as the face 
        and voice of Totsy.</p>
      <p>That's a big job, but she's earned it! She's been working in the online and 
        social media worlds in NYC as Senior Editor of Celebrations.com (owned by 
        1-800-Flowers.com) giving advice with national experts like Preston Bailey on making all 
        of life's occasions more special; managing PR and social media projects for major 
        brands like Mikasa, Henri Bendel and Harry Winston and as Editor-in-Chief of 
        StarStyle, which was a groundbreaking "supersite" that enabled viewers to identify 
        and purchase the apparel, furnishings and music featured in their favorite TV 
        shows and music videos.</p>
      <p>This was all after she graduated with her law degree from the University of 
        Mississippi School of Law and practiced law in MS for two years. </p>
      <p><strong><em>"Diana is Totsy's resident Chief Mom... that's Chief Editor and Director of 
      Social Media, but we like to think of her as the face and voice of Totsy."</em></strong></p>
      <p>Then of course, she's a mom to 2 little girls and wife to a British-born 
        entrepreneur. So, she knows all about being an international family, traveling between 
        her hometown on Mississippi's Gulf Coast and her in-laws home in London.</p>
      <p>Her favorite topic of late is how a newborn and a toddler may or may not be able 
        to share a room together! (that's still TBD)</p>
      <p>Diana has appeared on Access Hollywood, Inside Edition, CBS News and WPIX 11 to 
        discuss trends in fashion, style and party planning. She recently shot an 
        episode for a new series on BRAVO called "Pregnant in Heels" which will air in the 
        spring of 2011. </p>

      <p>She says that after having her first baby in July 2008, she discovered that, despite nearly everything she had heard and read, having a baby just wasn't that expensive! We never had that feeling, so it must be because she's a finance whiz! Luckily, Marybeth decided to share her knowledge and shopping expertise with the world, and boy are we glad she did! </p>
      <p><strong><em>"Marybeth discovered that, despite nearly everything she had heard and read, having a baby just wasn't that expensive!"</em></strong></p>
      <p>Before becoming a mom to two under two (now, two under three!), Marybeth earned a Bachelor of Business Administration degree with a major in finance and a minor in communication. After 8 years of enthusiastically climbing the corporate ladder, she became a stay-at-home-mom. Now, she is proud to announce that her second job is being a Minnesota mom blogger! Marybeth lives with her husband, two kids, one amazing shelter dog and two rescued cats near Minneapolis.</p>
      <p>As you can tell, Marybeth has a lot on her plate, but when she does have a few hours to spare, she always tries to spend quality time with her extended family and close friends. She loves reading, big Broadway musicals, Diet Coke, shopping and Starbucks lattes, and she'll take any of those in any order!</p>

      </ul>
<p>Vera Sweeney is the genius mom who founded I'm Not Obsessed.com, Lady and the Blog.com and several others and we're not afraid to admit that we are, well, obsessed with Vera and her sites. </p>
<p>Prior to blogging, Vera was a business consultant for Accenture working primarily in the financial industry for clients like JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Vanguard, Sumitomo Bank and Mt. Sinai Hospital. After having her first child in 2005, she became a stay at home mom and I'm Not Obsessed was born. INO offers "gossip without the guilt" and is geared towards women who have a love for celebrity gossip (just like us!) but want their news sans the raunchiness of other websites (yes, please!).</p>
<p>We love that Vera makes INO a safe place for people to visit while at work or surfing the web at home with their children nearby. She keeps all content clean and all pictures rated-PG!</p>
<p>In September of 2009, LadyAndTheBlog.com was added to the ever-growing INO brand. LATB is full of great product reviews including beauty and fashion lines, children's equipment, clothing, and accessories, and press previews for next season's must haves. LATB also focuses on how to dress like a celebrity and teaches readers to do it for less. Genius! </p>
<p><strong><em>"I'm Not Obsessed offers gossip without the guilt!"</em></strong></p>
<p>Her family business receives an average of 5 million page views a month! Vera lives in NYC with her hubby and two kids. </p>
